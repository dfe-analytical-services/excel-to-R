# Introduction

Whilst your data may be held in an Excel-format/database, it is worth using the power of Git and version control to ensure your team works together successfully when making updates, as well as ensuring there is a central repository where all revisions can be viewed since the start of the R-based project.

Thankfully, this repo has already been set up. However, this page will discuss how to clone (i.e. copy) the repo to your local machine so that you can make revisions there, set up version control and the pull/push process for any updates.
