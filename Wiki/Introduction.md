# Introduction
Welcome to a set of useful tips for moving from using Excel to using R. This wiki is designed to guide you through the process of setting up the back end and database manipulation, 
working with R Shiny and the front end of whatever tool/dashboard you create, and ongoing development scheduling and management.

Each wiki page covers a specific element of the process, though it is recommended that interested users work through each section at least once to ensure they have a full grasp of the process from start to finish.
