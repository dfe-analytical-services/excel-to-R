#  Introduction

R Shiny is used extensively within the department to showcase data from a variety of sources, both from static Excel-based files as well as dynamic databases.

The value of R shiny is in its customisability - whilst pre-built programs/packages such as Power BI, Tableau, Microstrategy Analytics and others offer a foundation upon which to work at high speed, they are proprietary and require licensing, as well as offering less freedom in how to manipulate data, and indeed the data sources accepted.

R Shiny in conjunction with R connect offers developers a rapid way of loading data from source to end users without requiring users to install additional software. In addition, R shiny is just one aspect of R, a statistical programming language that continues to develop at speed due to being open source. This means that R shiny offers a far wider variety of analyses and design elements (e.g. machine learning outputs, interactive charts, highly customised layouts), it only requires a developer to install the requisite package.

# Installation and Training

R shiny can be installed in the same way as any other R package. In the R command line type:

`install.packages("R shiny")`

Since R Shiny is open source, there are a wide variety of pages offering a run through of the fundamental basics, as well as
