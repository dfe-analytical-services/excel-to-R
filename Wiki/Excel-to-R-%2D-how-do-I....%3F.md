A barrier to transitioning from using Excel to using R is that an experienced Excel user may wonder "how do I do that simple Excel task (e.g. summing a column) in R?" 

The purpose of this page is to explain how to do Excel tasks in R. We focus on methods that can be applied to the [R data frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame), using the [dplyr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8) package for data manipulations.  


| **Task** | **How to do in R dataframe (with dplyr)** |

| List unique entries in field (column) |  |
| Filter/select based on criteria |   |
| Select specific columns|   |
|   |  |
| If else with OR |  |
| Countifs |  |
